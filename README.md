# WP Light
Our non-appreciation to Matt Mullenweg.

> This project is under development. Doesn't ready.

What makes WordPress so widely used today is its open-source nature. And open-source means that it's developed by a community of people who want to do it. Matt Mullenweg, the founder of WordPress, unilaterally decided to block access and steal the intellectual property of WP Engine... This cannot be accepted.

So we had an idea. And now a reflection. Can we continue with WordPress without Matt? The answer is yes. Mullenweg himself talks about it [here](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/).

In bonus, can we make sure that an issue like this don't happen again? We think the answer is yes too. We think that the simple fact of remove the subversion management from WordPress and give it to the user via git or svn is the key for prevent that.


***What we want for the project***
- Provide a WordPress without Gutenberg and blocks
- Reduce the power of WordPress by allowing it to manage only what it wants to display on the network, namely themes, plugins, and profiles. For example, someone who chooses to do business with ACF should not end up overnight with a stolen copy called SCF. So it is a requirement: the community must be able to give its updates to their customers without being intercepted by gourvenance.
- Stop manage via svn, use git.
- Start anew and forget the 100+ repos of WordPress.
